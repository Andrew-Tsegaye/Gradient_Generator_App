# Gradient Generator App

Gradient Generator is an online web application that allows users to generate and customize their own gradient backgrounds for web and graphic design projects. It provides a user-friendly interface with sliders and color pickers to adjust the hue, saturation, and lightness of each color stop in the gradient, and allows users to preview the results in real-time. The generated gradient can be copied as CSS code for use in web development projects, or exported as an image file for use in other design applications.

> This app can be useful for web designers and developers looking for an easy and convenient way to create and experiment with gradient backgrounds, without having to manually write the CSS code or use more complex image editing software.
